# Laptop Price Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of laptop prices to explore relationships between various laptop features (e.g., brand, processor, RAM, screen size, battery life, operating system, and storage) and their corresponding prices. SQL queries were used to extract insights from the dataset, and Power BI was employed to create interactive visualizations for better understanding and presentation.
