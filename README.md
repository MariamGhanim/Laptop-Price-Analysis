# Laptop Price Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of laptop prices to explore relationships between various laptop features (e.g., brand, processor, RAM, screen size, battery life, operating system, and storage) and their corresponding prices. SQL queries were used to extract insights from the dataset, and Power BI was employed to create interactive visualizations for better understanding and presentation

## SQL Queries
The project contains the following SQL queries:

1. **Average Laptop Price by Brand**: This shows the average price of laptops from different brands.

2. **Overall Average Price**: This calculates the average price of all laptops in the dataset.

3. **Effect of Processor on Price**: This looks at how the type of processor in a laptop affects its price.

4. **Relationship Between RAM and Price**: This checks how the amount of RAM in a laptop impacts its price.

5. **Companies Offering Laptops with Longer Battery Life**: This shows which laptop brands have better battery life.

6. **Resolution and Battery Life**: This looks at whether laptops with high-resolution screens have shorter battery life.

7. **Most and Least Used Operating Systems**: This finds out which operating systems are used the most and least in laptops.

8. **Average Prices by Screen Size**: This checks how screen size affects the price of laptops.

9. **Common Screen Sizes for High-Priced Laptops**: This identifies which screen sizes are most common in expensive laptops.

10. **Storage Size and Price Relationship Across Screen Sizes**: This looks at how storage size affects laptop prices based on the screen size.

11. **Average Prices by Storage**: This shows the average price of laptops depending on their storage size.
